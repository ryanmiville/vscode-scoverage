# VS Code Scoverage 

extension for viewing coverage data generated by scoverage 

## TODO
* check version (scala 3 will be v2)
* Remember selected file
	* add _select scoverage file_ command
* Show statement and branch rate in status bar
* Find "project" for each file to display as label in dropdown
	* look for `target` then go one up
		* if `target` is top, call it _root_
		* if no `target`, just use path
* Run scoverage from bloop?
	* can you and does it make sense?
	* can I use anything from metals?
* If no bloop, use sbt? support other build tools? probably too much scope
